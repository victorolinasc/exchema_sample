# Exchema Simple API 

A very brief and simple example of using `exchema` for validating input in an API.

`exchema` is a refinement types library for making validation code of external input more trustworthy.

## Instructions

All you need is mix and hex. After cloning, run this from the root of the project:

`mix do deps.get, deps.compile`

And then:

`iex -S mix`


You're done :)
